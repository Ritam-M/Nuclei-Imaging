# Nuclei-Segmentation in Cells.

Deep Learning has wide range of applications in Imaging, and Medical Imaging is one of them. This repository is a Pytorch Adaptation to the work done by Debesh Jha.
Here, I implemented the paper: DoubleU-Net: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Medical Image Segmentation (CBMS 2020), and tried different variants to the Residual Connections to the Double-UNet Architecture. 2 of them are replacing ResNet Skeleton with Mobile-Net and Adding Attention layers on top of ResNet, which improved the Overall Dice Score by a margin of 0.05.
