# Nuclei-Imaging

Deep Learning has wide range of applications in Imaging, and Medical Imaging is one of them. This repository is a Pytorch Adaptation to the work done by Debesh Jha.
Here, I implemented the paper: DoubleU-Net: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Medical Image Segmentation (CBMS 2020).

This paper focusses on Double UNet, and I picked the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2018 as 1 of the datasets to perform a comparative analysis upon.
