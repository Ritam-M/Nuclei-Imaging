# Nuclei-Segmentation, Polyp Detection in Cells, and Lesion Boundary Segmentation in Gastro-Intestinal Images.

Deep Learning has wide range of applications in Imaging, and Medical Imaging is one of them. This repository is a Pytorch Adaptation to the work done by Debesh Jha.
Here, I implemented the paper: DoubleU-Net: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Medical Image Segmentation (CBMS 2020), and tried different variants to the Residual Connections to the Double-UNet Architecture and improved the Overall Dice Score by a margin of 0.05.
